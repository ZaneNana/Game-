-Anime. I've been a "huge" fan of anime since I was just a kid. ("Aren't we always kids?" Heh.. The little boy/girl never leaves from you, It stays inside of you forever.. The memories that you made when you were young. The feelings that you had..)
-Nature & Animals. I've had many animals since I was young. They are like.. Part of my family.
-Messing around with friends. We always had that one friend who always had "Crazy" ideas. As he/she told us the ideas.. Sometimes we followed her/him, and heh.. Got in trouble.

I live in Finland.
